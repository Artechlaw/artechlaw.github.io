# About the Project

ArTechLaw is a network of researchers and practitioners from the fields of law, art, and technology seeking to probe relationships between the three disciplines.

It was born out of connections formed through the International Society for the History of Intellectual Property (ISHTIP) which brought together legal historian Isabella Alexander, historian of art and law, Cristina Martinez, art law scholar Andrea Wallace, and design and copyright law scholar Stina Teilmann-Lock. They in turn reached out to art historian and curator Cynthia Roman, and digital humanist Leo Impett, and ArTechLaw was born.

The project is supported by 2 grants:
- Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant Hacking Copyright in the 21st Century: Art, Law, History & Technology (DP200101046)
- Danish Research Council ArTechLaw Research Network (9055-00075B)

## Project Goals
- Explore the re-use of images using neural networks, including generating software that allows users to identify derivative images and patterns of re-use;
- Investigate how different disciplines conceptualise notions such as “original” and “copy”, and what copying means in different contexts;
- Create methodologies for addressing computational and infrastructural modes of visualization of images and the sourcing of cross-disciplinary research data in the study of art, technology, and law; 
- Enable more sophisticated discussion on how artistic practices and copyright law for visual cultural materials can better inform one another for the benefit of cultural heritage institutions.

## What are we doing?
The COVID-19 pandemic required us to reassess some of our original plans to carry out traditional face-to-face collaboration, but we made a virtue of necessity, seeking to carve out non-traditional spaces to facilitate meaningful engagement between people from different disciplines and backgrounds.
